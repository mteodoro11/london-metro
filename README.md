# london-metro
Project developed within the context of the Data Structures and Algorithms class at Iscte.

This project is based on the structure of the London Subway and has two parts:

  1. Split the Subway line in two, with the minimum possible cost.
  2. Replicate a program that lets users know which is the fastest time they can do between stations in the London Subway, and the corresponding shortest path.
